## Project 0 
Modeling
- Use Lumped Parameter Modeling, or other modeling that you are familiar with
(or even learn by researching), to derive a Transfer-Function for this Open-Loop
system. Clearly walk through the derivation.
• Hardware
You need to find and use data-sheets/manuals for this section.
Build the T-RECS
include necessary electrical schematics that will aid in explanations.
Give details that you will use in the following section about how to use/read the
potentiometer (model sv03A103AE01R00).
– You do not need to look into how a Brushless DC Motor/ESC works (we will talk
about that later in the class), but you should get the ESC manual and explain
how the inputs to the ESC to get the motor to run. You should also explain the
physics of how a prop motor produces thrust.
• System Identification
– Combining all the previous details that you have derived and researched, you will
now do some basic open-loop system experimentation to identify (or validate) any
parameters in your model. For this initial project, you can use the provided Nano
and sample codes to do these experiments. Note, be wary of any sample code
that you use and make sure you understand what’s going on.
