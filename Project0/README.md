Project #0: T-RECS: Build; Model; System Identiﬁcation

Due: See Canvas ”Assignments”

For this project, you will build and set up, model, and perform some experimental sys-

tem identiﬁcation on, the T-RECS and present all of that in a report form (written in Latex).

Your report should include, but not limited to, the following aspects:

• Report Writing

– Tell a good story

– Quality Figures

– Take Pride in your work

– There should be a suﬃcient amount of information and directions so that someone

can replicate this work

• Modeling

– Use Lumped Parameter Modeling, or other modeling that you are familiar with

(or even learn by researching), to derive a Transfer-Function for this Open-Loop

system. Clearly walk through the derivation.

• Hardware

– You need to ﬁnd and use data-sheets/manuals for this section.

– Build the T-RECS

– include necessary electrical schematics that will aid in explanations.

– Give details that you will use in the following section about how to use/read the

potentiometer (model sv03A103AE01R00).

– You do not need to look into how a Brushless DC Motor/ESC works (we will talk

about that later in the class), but you should get the ESC manual and explain

how the inputs to the ESC to get the motor to run. You should also explain the

physics of how a prop motor produces thrust.

• System Identiﬁcation

– Combining all the previous details that you have derived and researched, you will

now do some basic open-loop system experimentation to identify (or validate) any

parameters in your model. For this initial project, you can use the provided Nano

and sample codes to do these experiments. Note, be wary of any sample code

that you use and make sure you understand what’s going on.

• References

• Appendices (for example, code portions or derivations that you think shouldn’t be in

the body of the report but should be in the appendices).
